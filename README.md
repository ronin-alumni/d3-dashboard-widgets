# D3 Dashboard Widgets
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project created to serve as an example scaffolding to use for a D3 dashboard setup. When using visualizations in a "dashboard" layout, there's often several visualizations that need to share the same scales, but be located in different areas. This project creates a modular framework for a dashboard setup that gets new visualizations added over time, and can react to other visualizaitons in the same dashboard being interacted with.

## Dev environment
```bash
npm install
docker-compose up
```
